		</form>

		<p>This form sends your attempted credentials to /login_post/ as a POST request.
		The server uses <code>request.FormValue(...)</code> to access these fields and
		then queries the "accounts" SQL table for a match. The password is first
		hashed before querying, because the plaintext wouldn't match with the hashed version,
		which the database holds.</p>

		<p>On a successful match, your credentials are cached as cookies and you are
		redirected to "/". If there's no match, meaning that your credentials are
		wrong, you are redirected back to /login/ to try again, where you will see the
		cached "unsuccess" alert.</p>

		<p>This page, login.html, along with register.html, are only visible because
		you are logged out. When your browser made the request to /login/, the
		server checked for the relevant cookies in the request and found none, so
		it was able to correctly serve the Log In page. If you were signed in, you
		would have been redirected to "/" using <code>http.Redirect(...)</code>.</p>
