		<form action="/register_post/" method="post">
			<input name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username">
			<input name="password" type="password" placeholder="Password">
			<input name="confirm" type="password" placeholder="Confirm your password">
			<input type="submit" value="Register">
		</form>

		<p>The above form sends a POST request to /register_post/, which will look at
		the form inputs to decide what values to submit to the accounts SQL table, which
		keeps track of registered accounts. After doing so, the register page is no
		longer necessary, so you are redirected to "/", from where you can enter the
		lobby to find a game.

		<p>Before inserting it into accounts, however, a few checks are run on the input.
		For example, we need to confirm that the two provided passwords match, and that
		the username provided has not been already registered.</p>

		<p>The username validity is checked with
		<code>regexp.MustCompile(...).MatchString(...)</code>, but the primary purpose
		of this is <em>not</em> avoiding SQL injection, which would be a pretty
		reasonable assumption. The thing is, Go's SQL library (database/sql) already has
		built-in defense against SQL injection in the form of the "?" syntax.</p>

		<p>The function for querying tables is <code>db.Query(...)</code>
		and the function for modifying data is <code>db.Exec(...)</code>, which might
		make you want to try using <code>fmt.Sprintf(...)</code> inside one of these.
		However, as the aforementioned "?" syntax is not present, SQL injection <em>will</em>
		be a possibility and so you will need to create your own detection system.</p>

		<p>Instead, the better way is to, when using a variable, write a question mark
		and then provide the corresponding Go variable as a subsequent argument to the
		SQL library function. For example, instead of
		<code>db.Query(fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username = %v", my_username))</code>,
		use <code>db.Query("SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username = ?", my_username)</code>.</p>
